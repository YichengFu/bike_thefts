# Toronto Bike Thefts Analysis

## Overview

This repository explores patterns and predictors of bicycle theft in Toronto using data from Toronto Police Open Data (2013â€“present). Through logistic regression and Bayesian modeling, the analysis identifies significant predictors such as neighborhood, time of day, theft type, and bicycle value. The findings aim to guide theft prevention strategies and inform urban safety measures. The repository includes all data, code, and documentation necessary to reproduce the analysis and results.
