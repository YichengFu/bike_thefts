# Toronto Bike Thefts Analysis

## Overview

This repository investigates patterns and predictors of bicycle theft in Toronto using statistical modeling with data from Toronto Police Open Data (2013â€“present). The analysis explores how factors such as neighborhood, time of day, theft type, and bicycle value influence the likelihood of theft. Using logistic regression, the study identifies significant predictors and provides insights to guide theft prevention strategies. The repository includes data, code, and documentation supporting the analysis and findings.
